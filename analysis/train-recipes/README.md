# turbo-train-recipes

Recipes that train models only on permissive data, and the
accuracy gate each model passes before it ships (#401, #415).
docs/analysis.md ("Models trained on permissive data" and "Model gates")
describes both. The MASC recipes come first here; the recipes on the
CC BY 4.0 Universal Dependencies treebanks are under "The UD recipes".

| Module | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `masc` | MASC 3.0.0 (CC BY 3.0 US): the release record, its zoo dataset entry and fetch, the digest of an extracted copy, the fixed split, and the Twitter genre left out of it |
| `segmentation` | The English sentence detector and tokenizer recipes: training on the split's training documents, the held-out samples, scoring a model with OpenNLP's evaluators, the gate against the OpenNLP English UD model |
| `postag` | The English part-of-speech tagger recipe, the same way: training on MASC's Penn tags, the held-out samples, scoring with `POSEvaluator`, the gate against OpenNLP's English Penn tagger (`en-pos-maxent.bin`, OpenNLP 1.5) |
| `card` | The model card, the model's directory (model, `card.json`, `gate.json`) and its permissive zoo entry, made only for a card whose gate against its recipe's reference (by id and SHA-256) passed on the recorded release |
| `treebank` | The CC BY 4.0 UD treebanks at release 2.16: each repository's `LICENSE.txt`, `README.md` and `train`, `dev` and `test` files with their sizes and digests, the licence check, the zoo dataset entry and fetch |
| `ud` | The UD recipes: the samples, training on `train`, the checks run before training, and the gate on `test` against the OpenNLP UD 1.3 model (the zoo's, or the Italian ones recorded by digest), by the `segmentation` and `postag` gates and, for the lemmatizer, `LemmatizerEvaluator` |
| `ud_card` | The UD model card, with the treebank's licence, attribution and citation and the MASC card's held-out and gate parts, the model's directory and its zoo entry |

```
cargo run --release -p turbo-train-recipes -- masc --corpus <masc-dir> \
    --references <dir> --out <dir> [--unrecorded-corpus] [--recipe <model id>]...
cargo run --release -p turbo-train-recipes -- fetch-masc --home <zoo-home>
```

`--references` is a directory holding the reference models under their
published file names: `opennlp-en-ud-ewt-sentence-1.3-2.5.4.bin` and
`opennlp-en-ud-ewt-tokens-1.3-2.5.4.bin`, as `cargo run -p
turbo-goldens-tool -- fetch-models <dir>` writes them and checked against
the zoo's SHA-256, and `en-pos-maxent.bin`, downloaded by hand from
<https://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/en-pos-maxent.bin> and checked
against the size and SHA-256 the recipe records (5,696,197 bytes,
`645a094f45a866687a617385233fd23ae8b0f5fa8b1b76996781a50c17bdcf3d`).
`--recipe` runs only the recipes named by the trained model's id; without
it every recipe runs. The recipes run in the order of the table below,
whatever the order they are named in. Before anything is trained, every
reference the run needs is read and checked, every model directory it
would write is checked not to exist, and every recipe's training and
held-out samples are read and checked as training and the gate check
them (the skipped sentences of each side, and the held-out tokens whose
tag the tagger's reference cannot give): a run with a reference missing
or wrong, a model directory already there, or a recipe whose data fails
those checks names every such problem and writes nothing. The exit
status is 1 when a gate fails and 2 on an error.

## The recipes

| Model | Reference | Data | Measure |
|---|---|---|---|
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-sentence-1` | `opennlp-en-ud-ewt-sentence-1.3-2.5.4` | MASC sentence samples of 10 sentences | F-measure of sentence spans |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-tokens-1` | `opennlp-en-ud-ewt-tokens-1.3-2.5.4` | MASC Penn tokens, one sample per sentence | F-measure of token spans |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-pos-1` | `opennlp-en-pos-maxent-1.5` (`en-pos-maxent.bin`) | MASC Penn tokens and their `msd` tags, one sample per sentence | Word accuracy, one unit per sentence |

- Split: the documents in the reader's order (each directory's headers
  by name); positions 9, 19, 29 and so on are held out, one in ten. No
  randomness, so no seed. A document the reader skips (it logs the
  error and leaves the document out, as OpenNLP's `MascDocumentStream`
  does) would move every document after it to the next position, so a
  corpus with one is refused (`Error::SkippedDocuments`); MASC 3.0.0
  has none. MASC's Twitter genre is left out of both sides
  (`masc::EXCLUSIONS`, `Exclusion::TwitterGenre`), as Kristian Rickert
  decided on 2026-10-15: a document whose header's `textClass` names
  the category `TW` of MASC's taxonomy (`catRef="WR TW"`, "tweets"),
  which in MASC 3.0.0 are the two documents of `data/written/twitter`
  and no other. The positions are counted over every document read, so
  leaving the genre out moves no other document from one side to the
  other. The card lists the documents left out
  (`corpus.excluded_documents`), and the gate record's held-out set is
  named with the exclusion.
- Parameters: those the UD 1.3 models were trained with
  (`ud::training_parameters`: GIS, 300 iterations, cutoff 5, 4 threads),
  the factory defaults for English (for the tagger: the default feature
  generator descriptor, no tag dictionary, beam size 3), OpenNLP 2.5.4's
  whitespace, and a fixed manifest `Timestamp` (2026-10-14T00:00:00Z), so
  a run gives the same model bytes. The sentence detector's and the
  tokenizer's references, UD 1.3 models, were trained with the same
  settings, so they differ from the trained models in their data alone.
  The tagger's reference was not: its manifest records OpenNLP 1.5.0, 100
  iterations and cutoff 5, and it holds a tag dictionary (`tags.tagdict`)
  and no feature generator descriptor, so its gate compares data and
  settings together.
- Samples: what OpenNLP's MASC streams read, except that the token
  stream skips a sentence without a sample (no tokens, or an empty
  token) alone, where OpenNLP's stops reading the corpus, and a sentence
  whose tokens are out of text order alone, which the port's
  `TokSpanEventStream` refuses (`segmentation::read_token_samples`); and
  the part-of-speech stream skips a sentence with a token without a tag
  alone, where OpenNLP's throws and ends the training run; a sentence of
  no tokens gives the tagger no event and no held-out unit, and is
  skipped too. MASC 3.0.0 has one sentence whose tokens are out of text
  order, in `data/spoken/face-to-face/Bed012`: its Penn layer has a
  token `non-deterministic` over three quarks and a token `-` over the
  second, inside it. OpenNLP's `TokSpanEventStream` would make events of
  it, among them a split inside `non-deterministic` after `non-`, where
  it also gave a no-split. Held-out sentences are skipped the same way.
  The card records how many training sentences
  (`training.skipped_sentences`) and how many held-out sentences
  (`held_out.skipped_sentences`) were skipped, and a recipe fails when
  its reader skips more than one in a thousand of either
  (`MAX_SKIPPED_SENTENCES`), so a held-out document whose tags are
  missing cannot drop out of the gate. In the recorded release (corpus
  digest `445449f5...`, the Twitter genre left out), the token recipe
  skips that one training sentence of 24,958 and the tagger none; of
  the 6,385 held-out sentences the token and tagger recipes each skip
  one, a sentence of no tokens; the sentence detector skips none.
- The tagger's gate: MASC's tags are Penn tags, so the reference is
  OpenNLP's English maxent tagger of the 1.5 models, `en-pos-maxent.bin`.
  OpenNLP's only English taggers trained on Penn tags are that one and
  the 1.5 perceptron tagger; the maxent one is trained with the
  algorithm the recipe uses. The reference is asked for Penn tags
  (`PosTagFormat::Penn`), its own outcomes, which come out unconverted,
  and the trained model for its outcomes as they are, MASC's tags; the
  card records both formats. The trained model's tag is compared with
  the held-out tag as written. The reference's tag is compared through a
  mapping of its tags (`postag::REFERENCE_MAPPINGS`), where MASC 3.0.0
  follows another convention than the reference: brackets, which MASC
  tags `(` and `)` and the reference `-LRB-` and `-RRB-`; hyphens,
  which MASC tags `-` or `:` and the reference `:` (MASC tags most en
  and em dashes `NN`, which the mapping does not touch); ellipses, `...`
  in MASC and `:` in the reference; the two semicolons MASC tags `;` (it
  tags the other 725 `:`, as the reference does); and opening quotation
  marks, which MASC tags `''` as it tags closing ones (``` `` ``` only
  for a backtick), and the reference ``` `` ```. For those held-out tags
  the reference's tag of the other convention counts as right too; the
  trained model is not given that. The mapping is by tag, not by token,
  so it is lenient: the reference's ``` `` ``` counts right on every
  held-out `''`, also on a closing quotation mark (34 of the held-out
  `"` tokens it credits close a quotation and 30 are neither opening
  nor closing plainly). It only ever favours the reference, and those
  64 tokens are at most 0.08 points. A held-out token whose tag the
  reference cannot give, as written or through the mapping, would count
  against it whatever it did, so it is left out of both models' scores;
  the card lists those tokens by tag (`held_out.tokens.left_out`), and
  the recipe fails when they are more than one in a thousand of the
  held-out tokens (`MAX_TOKENS_LEFT_OUT`). The card also lists the
  reference's ten most frequent mismatches on the scored tokens
  (`held_out.tokens.reference_mismatches`), so a gap of convention the
  mapping does not cover, or an effect of the reference's tag
  dictionary, shows. The gate record (`gate.json`) holds the skipped
  held-out sentences and the scoring too (the tokens, those left out and
  the mapping), and its samples digest covers which tokens were scored
  and the mapping as well as the tokens and their tags. The reference's
  training data is not published, and the zoo does not list it: the
  recipe records its
  address, size and SHA-256 (`postag::EN_POS_MAXENT`), a run reads it
  from `--references` and checks it, and it is only scored. It is never
  shipped or bundled, and the trained model is trained on MASC alone.
  The English UD tagger is not the reference: asked for Penn tags,
  `POSTagFormatMapper` turns each of its UD outcomes into one Penn tag
  (`VERB` into `VB`, `NOUN` into `NN`, `PUNCT` into `.`), so it can never
  give `VBD`, `NNS`, `,` or `TO`, and a gate against it would pass any
  tagger.
- Licence: the models are Apache-2.0, trained on CC BY 3.0 US data, so
  their zoo class is permissive; the card carries the attribution CC BY
  asks for, which ships with the model: MASC 3.0.0, by the American
  National Corpus project (anc.org), its address and its licence.
  MASC's Twitter genre (two documents, 24,180 words, tweets from 2008
  whose headers give their source as unknown) is neither trained on nor
  scored, as Kristian Rickert decided on 2026-10-15: the licence policy
  refuses data under a platform's terms, and neither the release nor
  anc.org says whether Twitter's terms reach the tweets' text
  (docs/licences.md, "Datasets").
  Whether the ANC asks for a particular citation is to be confirmed on
  their site, which could not be reached from the machine the recipes
  were written and run on.

## The release record

MASC is fetched through the zoo by digest and read from its extracted
directory. It is not checked in: CC BY would allow it with attribution,
but the policy prefers fetching by digest. `masc::RELEASE` records the
release:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Archive | `MASC-3.0.0.zip`, zip |
| Address | <https://github.com/nancyide/anc-website/releases/download/datasets-2026-09-25/MASC-3.0.0.zip> |
| Size | 36,358,521 bytes |
| SHA-256 | `0b300d96016233c7c79b43559b477a6bb0ed16bb416d5c517eccb108a6228493` |
| SHA-512 | `a88795055fab5c600f26215cbe6143c2325627adaf9ae80d06c7e815a76834debd4b7728a745aa67608ee1d028b35ca139b2b90760e69d0e7227af83bf05d6a9` |
| Corpus directory | `MASC-3.0.0`, 4,425 files |
| Corpus digest | `445449f535cac62e74b2712ad975d7b727e72b8276720dd27492266565ae0afd` |

The archive is a release asset of the GitHub repository
`github.com/nancyide/anc-website` (tag `datasets-2026-09-25`), not a
file on anc.org itself. That anc.org's MASC download page links to it
was reported but not checked: anc.org could not be reached from the
machine the recipes were run on. What was checked there, on the
downloaded archive: its size, SHA-256 and SHA-512 above; it holds one
directory, `MASC-3.0.0`, with 4,425 regular files and no links; its
README dates the release 2012-12-15; and the corpus digest above. The
corpus digest (`masc::corpus_digest`) is the SHA-256 of a `sha256sum`
manifest of every file under that directory, so this gives the same
digest:

```
cd MASC-3.0.0 && find . -type f -printf '%P\n' | LC_ALL=C sort |
  while IFS= read -r f; do printf '%s  %s\n' "$(sha256sum -- "$f" | cut -d' ' -f1)" "$f"; done |
  sha256sum
```

`fetch-masc --home <zoo-home>` fetches the archive into
`<zoo-home>/artifacts/masc-3.0.0/` and checks its size and digests; the
zoo does not extract archives, so it is unzipped by hand, and `masc
--corpus` names the `MASC-3.0.0` directory it extracts to. `masc`
refuses a corpus directory whose digest is not the recorded one unless
given `--unrecorded-corpus`, and then writes cards with
`release_recorded: false`, which are not a release of the models (the
tests run the binary on their own corpora that way).

## Gates on the recorded release

`masc` run on the recorded release (corpus digest
`445449f535cac62e74b2712ad975d7b727e72b8276720dd27492266565ae0afd`: 351
training documents and 39 held out, the two of the Twitter genre left
out) with the three references from `--references`. Every gate passed.
The scores are in points, rounded to two places from the gate records'
values (`result.candidate.score`, `result.reference.score` and
`result.difference.mean`, `low` and `high` in `gate.json`; the card
repeats all of them but the difference's mean); the difference is the
paired bootstrap's mean with its 95% interval (10,000 resamples, seed
154), and a gate passes when the interval does not start below -0.5.

| Model | Units | Measure | Model's score | Reference's score | Difference (95% interval) | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-sentence-1` | 639 samples of 10 sentences | F-measure | 79.94 | 77.67 | +2.28 (+1.66 to +2.92) | pass |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-tokens-1` | 6,384 sentences | F-measure | 98.83 | 94.61 | +4.21 (+3.97 to +4.47) | pass |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-pos-1` | 6,384 sentences, 85,286 tokens scored | accuracy | 95.16 | 91.70 | +3.46 (+3.21 to +3.71) | pass |

Both models of a gate are scored on the same held-out samples, so the
held-out sentences skipped are skipped for both.

| Model | Training samples | Training sentences skipped | Events | Held-out sentences skipped | Held-out tokens left out |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-sentence-1` | 2,496 | 0 | 25,490 | 0 | |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-tokens-1` | 24,957 | 1 | 1,408,312 | 1 | |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-pos-1` | 24,958 | 0 | 431,637 | 1 | 6 of 85,292: `"` (2), `PRN` (1), ``UH` `` (3) |

The trained models are not checked in or published. A second run into
another directory wrote the same bytes:

| Model | Size | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-sentence-1.bin` | 44,601 bytes | `d03253a5559a230d1f42e1cf881119204302fbb7fefb613ff1af11bcbd3c261e` |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-tokens-1.bin` | 916,027 bytes | `2c5fe73121c41300e6eae4a3c4d7a2247ade20a1e182d8e36d7781124aa9b7db` |
| `turbo-en-masc-3.0.0-pos-1.bin` | 3,671,103 bytes | `391d7f79c7246e9e56ed9d8849fde129c5bed8683fa33af31e532cb0c37f96ea` |

The mapping of ``` `` ``` to MASC's `''` makes the tagger's reference
right on 336 more held-out tokens, 0.39 points: of the 644 held-out `"`
tokens MASC tags `''`, it tags 336 ``` `` ``` (272 that open a
quotation, 34 that close one and 30 neither plainly). The mapping is
lenient, by tag and not by token: a rule that knew which marks open
would not credit the 64 that do not, 0.08 points that only ever favour
the reference. Its ten most
frequent mismatches on the scored tokens, as the card lists them
(held-out tag, then the reference's): `NN` as `JJ` 446, `NN` as `NNP`
333, `NN` as `VB` 263, `JJ` as `NN` 230, `VBP` as `VB` 225, `NNP` as
`NN` 187, `NN` as `RB` 178, `IN` as `RB` 169, `NN` as `.` 146 and `NN`
as `VBP` 137.

Many of the `NN` rows are punctuation, which MASC tags `NN`: over the
split's documents it tags `[` (301) and `]` (312) `NN` every time, and
mostly `NN` the curly quotation marks (`“` 993 of 1,010 times, `”`
1,031 of 1,047, `‘` all 100, `’` 1,259 of 1,264), en dashes (91 of
100), em dashes (114 of 120) and `*` (all 307). On the held-out set
these are 1,309 `NN` tokens. The reference is wrong on 947 of them,
mostly because it does not know punctuation outside ASCII (it tags `”`
`.` 100 times and `''` 118 times), and the trained model, which learned
MASC's tags, on 7, so about 1.10 points of the 3.46-point lead come
from these tokens. Of them, only `”` as `''` is a Penn convention a rule
that looked at the token could credit; the recipe adds no mapping for
them. Scored without the 1,309 tokens, the gate still passes: 95.09
against 92.70, a lead of +2.39 (95% interval +2.18 to +2.63). The `NN`
rows also hold words that are not nouns, such as `pray`, `make`,
`right` and `fine`, many of them from a few held-out documents
(`data/written/fiction/Nathans_Bylichka`,
`data/written/movie-script/pirates`, `data/written/ficlets/1402` and
`data/spoken/debate-transcript/3rd_Bush-Kerry`). The `VBP` rows are
verbs such as `do`, `think` and `have`, and the `IN` rows words such as
`so`, `around`, `on`, `out` and `up`.

## The UD recipes

The treebanks of Universal Dependencies release 2.16 (tag `r2.16` of
each repository) whose own `LICENSE.txt` and README say CC BY 4.0,
read on 2026-10-14 (#415):

| Treebank | Components | Reference | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UD_Spanish-AnCora` | sentence, tokens, pos, lemmas | `opennlp-es-ud-gsd-*-1.3-2.5.4` | a README paragraph still says a GNU licence is inherited; `LICENSE.txt`, the metadata and the changelog (release 2.9) say CC BY 4.0 |
| `UD_Catalan-AnCora` | sentence, tokens, pos, lemmas | `opennlp-ca-ud-ancora-*-1.3-2.5.4` | the same README note; the references are trained on this treebank's `train` file |
| `UD_Portuguese-Porttinari` | sentence, tokens, pos, lemmas | `opennlp-pt-ud-gsd-*-1.3-2.5.4` | |
| `UD_Finnish-FTB` | pos, lemmas | `opennlp-fi-ud-tdt-*-1.3-2.5.4` | `LICENSE.txt` offers LGPLv3 or later or, at the user's option, CC BY 4.0; the recipes take CC BY 4.0 |
| `UD_Italian-MarkIT` | pos, lemmas | `opennlp-it-ud-vit-*-1.3-2.5.4`, recorded by size and SHA-256 | the references are trained on UD_Italian-VIT, CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, so they are local-only: read from `--references`, only scored, not in the zoo |

- Left out: `UD_Portuguese-DANTEStocks` is CC BY 4.0 too, but its text
  is tweets, and platform terms need a look before it is used, as for
  WNUT-17 (`docs/licences.md`), so it has no recipe. FTB and MarkIT
  have no sentence detector or tokenizer: their `text` comments put a
  space between every two tokens and no word has `SpaceAfter=No`, so they
  hold no sentence ends or tokenization of running text.
- Files: each treebank's `LICENSE.txt`, `README.md` and UD's `train`,
  `dev` and `test` files, with their sizes, SHA-256 and SHA-512 recorded
  in `treebank`, fetched through the zoo by digest from
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/UniversalDependencies/<repository>/r2.16/`
  (`fetch-ud`) as permissive datasets (`ud-<language>-<name>-r2.16`).
  They are not checked in.
- Licence check: `LICENSE.txt` must name the Creative Commons
  Attribution 4.0 International licence and its address, name no
  NonCommercial, ShareAlike or NoDerivatives element, and name a GNU
  licence only where the recipe records a choice beside CC BY 4.0, "at
  your option"; the README must have the metadata line `License: CC BY
  4.0`. Then every file must match its recorded size and digests, so a
  changed `LICENSE.txt` is refused too.
- Split: UD's own. Each model is trained on `train` and gated on `test`;
  `dev` is checked and not read.
- Parameters: those of the UD 1.3 models (GIS, 300 iterations, cutoff 5,
  4 threads), the factory defaults for the treebank's language, OpenNLP
  2.5.4's whitespace, 10 sentences per sentence detector sample, the
  universal tags, and the fixed manifest `Timestamp`. No randomness, so
  no seed.
- Samples: those of OpenNLP's CoNLL-U streams (a multiword token is one
  token, its words' tags and lemmas joined by `+`), except that the
  tagger's and the lemmatizer's leave out empty nodes (ids like `6.1`),
  which are not words of the text (AnCora writes their form `_`). A
  sentence left with no word would be skipped; the card records how many
  (none in these treebanks).
- The gate: both models scored on the `test` samples with OpenNLP's
  `SentenceDetectorEvaluator`, `TokenizerEvaluator`, `POSEvaluator` and
  `LemmatizerEvaluator` (gold tags given to the lemmatizer), one unit per
  sample, gated by `turbo_eval::model_gate`. The gates are the MASC
  recipes': a sentence detector or tokenizer is gated as a
  `segmentation::SegmentationRecipe`, and a tagger as a
  `postag::PosRecipe` of its own (`UdRecipe::tagger`), with both models'
  tags asked for as their outcomes, the universal tags, and compared
  with the held-out tag as written: no mapping of the reference's tags,
  so the record's and card's `reference_mappings` are empty. A tagger's
  tokens whose gold tag the reference has no outcome for are left out of
  both models' scores, and the card lists them by tag with the
  reference's most frequent mismatches; more than 5 in 100 of the tokens
  (`ud::MAX_TOKENS_LEFT_OUT`) and the recipe fails. The MASC tagger's
  limit, 1 in 1,000 (`MAX_TOKENS_LEFT_OUT`), would refuse FTB, where the
  Finnish reference cannot give 3.9 in 100. The lemmatizer's units are
  recorded as a tag scoring with nothing left out and no mapping.
- Checks before training: the run reads and checks every reference
  (the zoo's digest, or the recorded size and digest) and checks that no
  model directory exists, then reads every treebank against its record,
  then checks every recipe's samples (`UdRecipe::check_data`, as
  `Recipe::check_data`: each file has a sample, at most 1 in 1,000
  sentences skipped on either side, and the tagger's left-out tokens
  within the limit), naming every problem, before any model is trained.
- Card and record: `card.json` is a `UdModelCard` (version 2): the
  treebank and its files, licence, attribution and citation where the
  MASC card has the corpus, and the MASC card's `training`, `held_out`
  and `gate` parts; it is read version first, as the MASC card is.
  `gate.json` is the MASC recipes' `ModelGateRecord` (version 2, with the
  held-out sentences skipped and the scoring). The run prints each
  card's summary (`UdModelCard::summary`, the lines
  `ModelCard::summary` prints), its gate record and the seconds the
  recipe took.
- The Italian references: OpenNLP's Italian UD models are trained on
  UD_Italian-VIT (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0), so they are local-only
  (`docs/licences.md`, "Non-commercial data") and the zoo's built-in
  index does not list them. `ud::IT_UD_VIT_POS` and
  `ud::IT_UD_VIT_LEMMAS` record each file's name, address, size and
  SHA-256 (the files of Maven Central's
  `org.apache.opennlp:opennlp-models-pos-it:1.3.0` and
  `opennlp-models-lemmatizer-it:1.3.0`, whose SHA-512 is the one Apache
  publishes beside them). A run reads them from `--references`, checks
  them and only scores them, as the MASC tagger's gate does
  `en-pos-maxent.bin`; the trained models are trained on MarkIT alone.
- Licence: the models are Apache-2.0 trained on CC BY 4.0 data, so their
  zoo class is permissive. The card carries the attribution (the
  treebank, its release, its contributors, its address and the licence)
  and the citation the treebank's README asks for. `UdModelCard::artifact`
  refuses a card as `ModelCard::artifact` does: one no recipe of
  `UD_RECIPES` trains, one whose class is not the one its licences give,
  one whose gate's reference is not the recipe's (by id and by the
  SHA-256 the zoo lists or the recipe records), and one whose gate
  failed, as the Italian models' do.

```
cargo run --release -p turbo-train-recipes -- fetch-ud --home <zoo-home>
cargo run --release -p turbo-train-recipes -- ud --treebanks <zoo-home>/artifacts \
    --references <dir> --out <dir> [--recipe <model id>]...
```

`--references` holds the OpenNLP UD 1.3 models under their published
file names (Maven Central `org.apache.opennlp:opennlp-models-<component>-<language>:1.3.0`,
or `archive.apache.org/dist/opennlp/models/ud-models-1.3`), checked
against the zoo's SHA-256, or for the Italian ones the recorded size and
SHA-256.

### Results

All sixteen recipes were run twice in release mode on 2026-10-15 on the
code of the merge of main at `eecd1eec` (`ud` with every recipe, 4
training threads on a 4-core machine), with the references checked
against the zoo's SHA-256 (the Italian ones against the recorded size
and SHA-256). The two runs wrote byte-identical model files, cards and
gate records. Every score and interval as printed, and every unit,
sample and event count, is the one the run before the merge
(`ecc524c1`) gave; what differs is the
format: the gate records are version 2, with the held-out sentences
skipped (0 for every recipe) and the scoring, the cards are version 2,
with the MASC card's held-out and gate parts, and a tagger's samples
digest is the MASC tagger's, which adds a byte per token for whether it
is scored and a count of 0 mappings, so the taggers' `samples_sha256`
differ from that run's. The fourteen models gated against references of
the zoo pass; the two Italian models fail. Scores are in points:
F-measure for the sentence detector and tokenizer, accuracy for the
tagger and lemmatizer, with 95 percent intervals from 10,000 paired
bootstrap draws (seed 154). A unit is a held-out sample: 10 sentences
for the sentence detector, one sentence otherwise. Time is the
wall-clock time of a recipe in the second run: training, scoring both
models and the gate. The trained models are not checked in.

- Tags left out of the taggers' gates, counted in the tagger's tokens
  of the `test` file whose gold tag the reference has no outcome for:
  Porttinari 6 of 31,451 (0.02 percent: `INTJ` 5, `ADP+ADP` 1), FTB 635
  of 16,261 (3.91 percent: `DET` 398, `PART` 234, `SCONJ+VERB` 3, tags
  the Finnish TDT reference never gives) and MarkIT 3 of 9,654 (0.03
  percent: `NOUN+PRON` 2, `DET+DET` 1); none for Spanish and Catalan. The
  taggers' scores above are over the other tokens, and each card lists
  the reference's ten most frequent mismatches on them (for FTB, `VERB`
  tagged `AUX` 303 times comes first). The lemmatizers' gates leave
  nothing out.
- The Italian models lose to OpenNLP's: the tagger by 2.21 points
  (interval -2.92 to -1.49) and the lemmatizer by 0.87 (-1.34 to -0.41),
  so a loss of more than 0.5 points is not ruled out for either, and
  `UdModelCard::artifact` makes no zoo entry for them. MarkIT's `train`
  file has 611 sentences.
- The Catalan references are OpenNLP's models of this treebank (the
  zoo records them as trained on `UD_Catalan-AnCora r2.16`), made with
  the settings the recipes take from the UD 1.3 models. The sentence
  detectors and tokenizers agree on every unit. The taggers differ on
  127 of the 1,846 units and the lemmatizers on 6. One difference in the
  data is known: the recipes leave the treebank's 4,999 empty nodes out
  of the tagger's and lemmatizer's training samples, and OpenNLP's
  streams keep them. Whether that accounts for all of it was not
  checked.
- The other references are trained on another treebank of the language
  (Spanish GSD, Portuguese GSD, Finnish TDT, Italian VIT), so a gap can
  come from the two treebanks' annotation as well as from the models;
  the widest is the Portuguese lemmatizer's 10.16 points.

## Tests

`tests/recipes.rs` writes corpora in MASC's layout (`tests/common`, no
MASC text, Penn tags written for the tests) and runs everything on
them: the split in the reader's order; the Twitter genre left out of
both sides without moving another document; the three recipes trained,
scored and gated; the same bytes from a second training; the card, the
model's directory and its zoo entry; the skipped sentences recorded and
bounded on both sides; a sentence with a token inside another skipped
by the token recipe alone; the tagger's tags compared as written and
the reference's through the mapping of its tags, with the tokens of a
tag the reference cannot give left out, and a
reference that cannot give most tags refused; and the binary's refusal
of an unrecorded corpus, of a missing or wrong reference, of an
existing model directory and of held-out data with too many skipped
sentences before it trains anything, and its output, with the lines it
prints of each card (`ModelCard::summary`: the samples and skipped
sentences of both sides, and the held-out tokens left out with their
tags) checked word for word. It
also reads the MASC corpora checked in for the goldens
(`analysis/goldens/data/inputs/formats/masc-*.txt`) with the tagger
recipe's reader: it reads every sample OpenNLP's `MascPOSSampleStream`
read from them in the JVM (the `masc/pos` goldens, whose generator reads
on after an exception), in order, skips one sentence for each exception
the JVM recorded, and refuses the corpus the JVM could not open with the
JVM's exception. The test corpora are made of eight sentences, so a
model trained on one has seen every held-out sentence and its score
there measures nothing. The gate is checked against a weaker model,
trained on plainer text (for the tagger, on the same sentences with
their tags moved one token along): as the reference it loses and the
trained model passes, and as the candidate it loses far more than the
margin and fails, which is the check that tells the gate from one that
passes everything. A model against itself passes with no difference.

The OpenNLP UD references need `TURBO_GOLDENS_MODELS` naming a
directory that holds them (`cargo run -p turbo-goldens-tool --
fetch-models <dir>`). With it, they are checked against the zoo's
digests and scored on the test corpus, the UD tagger asked for Penn tags
is checked to give only its 17 converted tags, and the binary runs end to
end on the recipes whose references are present (`--recipe`); without it
those parts skip, unless `TURBO_TEST_REQUIRE_OPENNLP_MODELS=1`, which
makes them fail. CI runs the test with both set, in the step that
requires the published models.

The tagger's reference, `en-pos-maxent.bin`, is local-only, as in
turbo-sequence's tests of the 1.5 models: its training data is not
published, so CI does not fetch it. The parts that need it run when
`TURBO_TEST_OPENNLP_MODELS` names a directory holding it (a missing file
there fails), and skip without it even with
`TURBO_TEST_REQUIRE_OPENNLP_MODELS=1`. With it, it is checked against the
recorded digest, shown to return its 45 Penn outcomes unconverted and
to tag brackets, hyphens, ellipses, semicolons and an opening quotation
mark as `postag::REFERENCE_MAPPINGS` says, and a closing quotation mark
`''`, scored and gated, and the binary runs all three recipes.

On the test corpus, with both directories set, the published references
score 63.16 (sentences, F-measure), 94.34 (tokens, F-measure) and 92.41
(`en-pos-maxent.bin`, accuracy), against 100 for the trained models,
which have seen every held-out sentence; the test checks these numbers,
which show the gate is wired through, not how the recipes do on MASC.

`tests/ud.rs` does the same for the UD recipes, on a treebank written for
the tests: eight Spanish sentences in CoNLL-U (with multiword tokens, an
empty node and `SpaceAfter=No`; no treebank text), a `LICENSE.txt` and a
README. It checks that the tagger's and lemmatizer's samples leave out
empty nodes and join a multiword token's tags and lemmas with `+`, and
the held-out digests: the tagger's is the MASC tagger's with no mapping,
the lemmatizer's covers the lemmas. It trains, scores, gates and writes
the card and directory of each of the four components against a
reference trained on two of the sentences: each candidate passes and
scores at least as high, with the record's scoring and digest and the
card's summary checked, except the tagger, which the check before
training and the gate both refuse because that reference has no outcome
for most of the gold tags. A reference trained without the interjection
leaves its 40 tokens out of both taggers' scores and onto the card, with
no mapping and both tag formats `custom`. A held-out file with one
sentence of 101 skipped is refused before training. A card gets a zoo
entry only for a recipe of `UD_RECIPES`, gated against that recipe's
reference and passed; an Italian card gated against the recorded
reference and failed gets none, and a card of another version is
refused by its version. A treebank whose file or licence changed is
refused. The binary
checks every reference (the zoo's digest or the recorded one) and that
no model directory exists, naming every problem, and reads every
treebank, before it trains anything; with the Italian tagger's
reference under `TURBO_TEST_OPENNLP_MODELS` it also checks that a
missing treebank is refused.
With `TURBO_TEST_OPENNLP_MODELS` naming a directory of the OpenNLP UD 1.3
models, each recipe's reference is checked against the zoo's digest (the
recorded one for the Italian models) and scored on the test text (Spanish for every language, so the scores only
show that each model loads and is scored); a missing file there is
skipped, or fails with `TURBO_TEST_REQUIRE_OPENNLP_MODELS=1`. CI does not
set `TURBO_TEST_OPENNLP_MODELS`, so that part runs only where the models
are present.
